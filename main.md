# Statistics, Quick and Dirty

## Intro

Welcome to Statistics, Quick and Dirty.  

By "Quick," I mean the breadth and depth of topics will be limited.
I do this so you won't need to read a dozen pages of explanation just to find out what an ANOVA is (for example).
However, it also means there is a limit to what you can learn here - this is aimed at people who either learned the content once and forgot, or have a working knowledge of math and need only be filled in on the details of some statistical method.  

By "Dirty," I mean that in the interest of "Quick," there will not be a lot of mathematical rigor.
There'll be plenty of mathematical notation, but little to nothing in the way of proofs.
If you don't have the mathematical background to either work out details yourself, or locate legible proofs elsewhere, you may want to find a more comprehensive book on statistics.  
Further, I'm going to use the terminology that makes sense to me.
I'm not going to intentionally diverge from standard practice among statisticians, but you may find some definitions that differ a bit from what a "true" statistician would say.
Again, I'm not doing this on purpose, it just may happen.
Terminology should stay consistent within this book, though.  
In any case, don't use this to cram for your college stats course.  

It's worth noting I don't know what kind of work to call this... document.
Maybe it's a book?
Maybe it's lecture notes?
Maybe it's a pamphlet?
Maybe a little bit of everything.
To keep things simple, I'm going to refer to it as a "book" anytime I need to comment on things at a big-picture level.
I make no guarantee this will live up to that title, but such is life.
You've been warned.
